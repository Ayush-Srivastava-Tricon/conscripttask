              		    Pages:

index.html
register.html
studentuser.html
viewdetails.html

            		 Description:

index: This page containes login of the registered user. If the user is not registered then he/she should register themself.

register: This page containes user information like name, username and password for which they will use to authenticate themself.

studentuser: This page containes a form for logged in user to register his/her details, followed by a View and Logout button.( on clicking on View button if the registered user has submitted the form then he/she would be able to see their details.

viewdetails: This page shows the details of registered student user.


Note: I have made this minor project in a way that each user is allowed to register his/her details only one at a time and view it infinity times. (though each user can fill up the student form many times but he/she would be able to view only the first registration form).
